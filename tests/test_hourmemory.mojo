"""An hour in flight holds about one file's worth of rows, not several
(magmalake/mojo-census#37).

A synthetic hour of 2023-sized events (60,000 events of about 4 KB: a full
50,000-row file of about 210 MB and a short one) goes through what an hour's
task does, `decode_index` into a `TableWriter`, and the peak RSS it adds is
checked against the rows' own size. A file's JSON is 197 MB; the write
before #37 (each file's rows as one batch, sorted by copying it, written as
one row group) added 832 MB under Linux and 778 MB on macOS, and that was
without the builders' doubling. Now it adds about 340 MB under Linux and 250
MB on macOS: the rows in their pieces, a row group of `GROUP_BYTES` in the
writer, its zstd contexts, and the allocator's slack.
